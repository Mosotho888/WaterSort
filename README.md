# sed -i 's/\<Developmets\>/Production/'
# WaterSort
Sorting colours in different tubes

## The problem the code solves
The different coloured water in the bottles are needed to be sorted until all the same colours are in the same glass

## Problem-Solving approach
I started by researching, understanding and analysing the problem while doing so, I wrote down the things i think will be needed roughly (e.g classes, checking colours, If/Switch statement, for/while loop, etc). Then i wrote down steps from where to start and end, in this case i started from writing and coding the MyArrayList then StackMyArrayList Classes to be able to create the bottles.
